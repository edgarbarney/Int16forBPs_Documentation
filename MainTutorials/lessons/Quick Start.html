	  <p>
	  Thank you for using the Int16 plugin.<br>
	  This quick start tutorial will show you basics of the Int16 plugin
	  </p>
      <h3 class="title_style">Installation</h3>
	  <p>
	  Installation is pretty easy.<br>
	  There are two ways of doing this.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <br>
	  First way is through the market<br>
	  Just navigate to the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/9017cc424df8476dadd4ed8db41f878b">page that you've got the plugin</a> and click to the "Install to Engine" button.
	   <br>

	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Second way is through the library vault.<br>
	  Just get to your library and search "Int16" in the vault.
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_2.png" />
	  <p>
	  After this, choose your engine version.<br>
	  When Installation is finished, open up your desired project and enable the plugin.
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_3.png" />
	  <p>
	  <br>
	   </ p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_4.png" />
	  <p>
	  Then, restart the engine.
	  <br>
	   </ p>
	  <br>

      <h3 class="title_style">Quick Start</h3>
	  <p>
	  After enabling the plugin, create a test actor.<br>
	  And right click to the blueprint grid to bring up the search bar.
	  And type in "int16" to see all nodes that you can use with Int16.<br>
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_6.png" />
	  <p>
	  For using Int16 as a variable, just create a variable.<br>
	  Then when choosing "Variable Type", type "integer" into the search bar.
	  You'll see the "integer16" in the list. Click on it to select it.<br>
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_7.png" />
	  <p>
	  Yes! Your variable is ready and you are good to go!<br>
	  Lets play around using standard UE4 time nodes and Int16's conversion nodes to get a grip of it.<br>
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_8.png" />
	  <p>
	  And yay!<br>
	  If you're in an odd number day of the year, you'll se a text like this:<br>
	  </p>
	  <img src="../img/Screenshot_9.png" />
	  <p>
	  And that is it. You're all set for using Int16 in your Blueprints.<br>
	  If you have any problems, you can email me for your questions or you can use Epic's marketplace.<br>
